README
------

A connector to connect to parity light node with web3x and send over ZMQ.

### Dependencies

- [vyper v0.1.0b4](https://github.com/ethereum/vyper/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta.4r)
- [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)

### Install

```
yarn install && yarn build
```

The first account returned by `eth_accounts` response will be used in order to sign transactions.
In order to make the signing work, you must unlock this account.
And in order to be able to create orders, you must call `swapbox.addMachine(<address>)` first.
You need to unlock the `account[0]` of your node, this is the `machineAddress` that will be used in 

### Running

Ensure an ethereum client is running

```bash
parity --light
```

You can edit `config.json` at your tastes before starting.

Start the connector

```bash
yarn start
```

### Private network

For testing purpose.

Run geth with the following:

```bash
geth --dev --ws --wsport=8546 --wsorigins="*" --wsapi personal,eth,net,rpc,shh,web3 --allow-insecure-unlock
```

And then run this from another terminal `smart-contract/` folder:

```bash
cd smart-contract/
geth --exec "loadScript('scripts/unlock.js')" attach ipc://tmp/geth.ipc
```

It will unlock 9 more accounts (so 10 in total) and prefund them with 1000 ETH each.

You will also need to deploy the contract:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

You can start with nodemon using:

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

### Accounts management

Generate key:

```
yarn genkey
```

Add key (needs ethereum client running)

```
yarn addkey
```

TO-DO
-----

- Point machine operator fee to value set in smart contract
- Add ZMQ authentication (https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/blob/master/examples/security/ironhouse.py??)
- Add methods for listening to transaction events for the purpose of advancing transaction process
- Add methods for calling contract?
